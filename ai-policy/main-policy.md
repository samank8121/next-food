## âœ… General AI Workflow Guidelines

1. **Step-by-Step Approval**:  
   AI must pause after each step and wait for explicit user approval before moving to the next one. If user have comments check the comments base on whole main policy and if it ddoesn't violate that move forward. if there is an issue tell the user.

2. **Best Practices Enforcement**:  
   Each implementation step must follow the structure outlined below and include comments or documentation as needed.

3. **Useless steps**:
   If each step is useless for a feature after user approval you can skip that one

## ğŸ§¼ Naming Convention
All files and folders must follow `kebab-case`. This includes:
- File names
- Folder names
- Component names (e.g., `feature-card.tsx`)

## ğŸ›‘ Disclaimer
AI must **not** auto-proceed or assume completion. Each phase must be reviewed and approved manually.
